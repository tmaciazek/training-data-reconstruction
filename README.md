# Vulnerability of Transfer-Learned Neural Networks to Data Reconstruction Attacks in Small-Data Regime

This repository is the official implementation of [Vulnerability of Transfer-Learned Neural Networks to Data Reconstruction Attacks in Small-Data Regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/). 

## Requirements

To install requirements (ideally in a separate environment):

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, make sure to setup the relevant datasets so that they can be used by Pytorch:

* [EMNIST](https://docs.pytorch.org/vision/main/generated/torchvision.datasets.EMNIST.html) and [MNIST](https://docs.pytorch.org/vision/main/generated/torchvision.datasets.MNIST.html#mnist)
* [CIFAR-100](https://docs.pytorch.org/vision/main/generated/torchvision.datasets.CIFAR100.html) and [CIFAR-10](https://docs.pytorch.org/vision/main/generated/torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10.html)
* [CelebA](https://docs.pytorch.org/vision/stable/generated/torchvision.datasets.CelebA.html)

The files [pretrain_conf_MNIST.yml](/config_data/pretrain_conf_MNIST.yml), [pretrain_conf_CIFAR.yml](/config_data/pretrain_conf_CIFAR.yml) and [pretrain_conf_CelebA.yml](/config_data/pretrain_conf_CelebA.yml) contain the entry `DataRoot` which is currently set to `.` and should be changed if the root directory for the respective datasets is different.
  

## Reproducing the reconstructor NNs

To reproduce the reconstructor NNs, one needs to follow the steps below. Note that you may skip the pre-training step and just use the models included in the folder [models_pretrained](/models_pretrained)

```train
python train.py --input-data <path_to_data> --alpha 10 --beta 20
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to train the models, with example commands on how to train the models in your paper, including the full training procedure and appropriate hyperparameters.

## Evaluation

To evaluate my model on ImageNet, run:

```eval
python eval.py --model-file mymodel.pth --benchmark imagenet
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to evaluate the trained models on benchmarks reported in the paper, give commands that produce the results (section below).

## Pre-trained Models

You can download pretrained models here:

- [My awesome model](https://drive.google.com/mymodel.pth) trained on ImageNet using parameters x,y,z. 

>ðŸ“‹  Give a link to where/how the pretrained models can be downloaded and how they were trained (if applicable).  Alternatively you can have an additional column in your results table with a link to the models.

## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on :

### [Image Classification on ImageNet](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet)

| Model name         | Top 1 Accuracy  | Top 5 Accuracy |
| ------------------ |---------------- | -------------- |
| My awesome model   |     85%         |      95%       |

>ðŸ“‹  Include a table of results from your paper, and link back to the leaderboard for clarity and context. If your main result is a figure, include that figure and link to the command or notebook to reproduce it.
